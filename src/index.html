        <div class="top chatter">The killing of Cecil the lion in Africa last summer sparked worldwide outrage. But itâ€™s common for Americans to hunt animals in foreign lands and ship them home. Last year, almost 500 shipments containing protected or endangered animals were sent legally through Seattle, and more than half of those included trophy animals.</div>

            <p>Many wildlife shipments include animal parts and products, such as meat, leather or shell jewelry. However, other shipments include trophy animals &mdash; whole game animals hunted and intended for display.
            <p>Last year, <strong>24%</strong> of wildlife shipments through the Port of Seattle contained at least one trophy animal. Most were hunted in Africa.
