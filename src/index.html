            Some animal species are protected by an international trade treaty called CITES. In 2014, <strong>27%</strong> of shipments through the Port of Seattle contained at least one animal currently considered in danger of extinction (CITES Appendix I) or considered in danger of extinction unless trade is controlled (CITES Appendix II).

          <div class="chatter trophies">
            <div class="subhed">Trophy animals</div>
            Many wildlife shipments include animal parts and products, such as meat, leather or shell jewelry. Other shipments include animals intended for display. Last year, <strong>24%</strong> of shipments through the Port of Seattle contained at least one trophy animal. Most of these trophies were hunted in Africa.

            <div class="subhed">Protected trophy animals</div>
            Animals protected by CITES must have proper documentation to be imported legally. Of the trophy animals shipped through the Port of Seattle last year, <strong>63%</strong> were protected by CITES Appendices I and II.

            <div class="subhed">Initiative I-1401</div>
            Voters this November will consider an initiative that would disallow most sales in Washington state of any parts of the following animals: elephants, rhinos, lions, tigers, leopards, cheetahs, pangolins, marine turtles, sharks and rays. Last year, <strong>4%</strong> of shipments through the Port of Seattle contained at least one of these animals.
