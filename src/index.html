            <p>Thousands of plant and animal species are protected under an international treaty known as CITES. Unlike the U.S. Endangered Species Act, which focuses on conservation, CITES protects threatened species through regulation of international trade.
            <p><strong>27%</strong> of shipments through the Port of Seattle in 2014 contained at least one animal currently classified as in danger of extinction (<a href="http://checklist.cites.org/#/en/search/cites_appendices%5B%5D=I&output_layout=alphabetical&level_of_listing=0&show_synonyms=1&show_author=1&show_english=1&show_spanish=1&show_french=1&scientific_name=&page=1&per_page=20">CITES Appendix I</a>) or in danger of extinction if trade is not controlled (<a href="http://checklist.cites.org/#/en/search/cites_appendices%5B%5D=I&cites_appendices%5B%5D=II&output_layout=alphabetical&level_of_listing=0&show_synonyms=1&show_author=1&show_english=1&show_spanish=1&show_french=1&scientific_name=&page=1&per_page=20">CITES Appendix II</a>).

            <p>Many wildlife shipments include animal parts and products, such as meat, leather or shell jewelry. However, other shipments include whole game animals hunted for sport or food and intended for display.
            <p>Last year, <strong>24%</strong> of shipments through the Port of Seattle contained at least one of these "trophy" animals. Most trophy animals were hunted in Africa.
